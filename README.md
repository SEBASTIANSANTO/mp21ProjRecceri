# Research Title: Comparative Study between SSD and HDD 

Brief Description:
With today’s advancements in technology, software that needs a powerful processor also needs a fast and huge amount of storage. But having both a fast and large storage comes at a hefty price and it isn’t even guaranteed to last a very long time. HDD’s are attributed to large but slow storages while SSD’s are attributed to fast but small storages.
